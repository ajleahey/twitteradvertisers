Dear [Advertiser],

I am writing to express my disappointment that your company continues to advertise on Twitter. While I understand the platform's value as a means of reaching a large audience, I cannot in good conscience support a company that chooses to advertise on a platform that has demonstrated a lack of commitment to combating misinformation and hate speech.

I hope that you will consider suspending ad purchases on Twitter in order to retain my business and the business of other consumers who share my values.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
